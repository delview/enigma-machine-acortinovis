#Atbash Cipher
#ask the user whether they want to decrypt or encrypt a message
#Accept a string that the program will either encrypt or decrypt.


#Create two functions that will accept parameters in the form of a list or a dictionary that will contain the string meant to be encrypted or decrypted.
#one function will encrypt


#the other will decrypt using the Atbash cipher technique.


# This should involve both loops and if statements.



#Either call a function to encrypt or to decrypt the string.




#Present the final encrypted or decrypted string to the user.
#The user must be able to copy that output and run it through the program again to perfectly encrypt or decrypt it multiple times without any mistakes
